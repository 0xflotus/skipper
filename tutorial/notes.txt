# The first route

nothing, 404
a route to example.org, inline, show the route in the log, make a request to /html and show the access logs
move the route to an eskip file, repeat the above request to verify
explain the eskip file

# A path predicate and a simple filter

a route to httpbin, inline, show the route in the log, make a request to /headers and show the access logs
select it with the path
move to curl

Path("/debug") -> setRequestPath("/headers") -> "http://loclahost:8080"

# A simple filter

we want /debug/headers
change the path

# etcd

multiple skippers using eventually consistent routing configuration
show eskip uploading the file
